# FGDA
For IJCAI 2019 &lt;An Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network for Cross-Domain Fine-Grained Recognition>.

We add extra details of our paper in this repository containing the following aspects:
+ Examples of our proprosed dataset ***MegRetail***,
+ Evaluation of **Self-Attention** module.

##Examples of our proprosed dataset ***MegRetail***

***MegRetail*** contains 52,011 instances from 24,908 images of 263 classes from 3 domains, enabling researcher to further study on domain adaptation fine-grained recognition task.
We randomly select 5 instances of 263 classes from 3 domains listing in [/MegRetail_Example](https://github.com/Anonymous2019IJCAI/FGDA/tree/master/MegRetail_Example)
